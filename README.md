# Yeast cell segmentation, tracking and cell lineage analysis
Python scripts for yeast cells segmentation, tracking and cell lineage analysis

## steps for running analyses with the code
### 1) split nd2/czi file into standardized folder structure by using the fiji script(s)
here come the instructions for doing so
### 2) Run YeaZ segmentation and tracking
here come the instructions for doing so
### 3) Run the script YeaSTac_GUI_frames.py for correcting segmentation and tracking
#### Edit Operations
Draw a new cell: *right-click* on right image. Roughly follow a bright contour to draw a new label (e.g. small bud missed by segmentation)
### 4) Run the script YeaSTaC_GUI_CellCycleAnalysis.py for performing cell cycle analysis
here come the instructions for doing so
